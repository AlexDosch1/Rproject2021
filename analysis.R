# plot: double bar graph, color coded by country with y-axis as markers present?
    # cowplot to show all the data from function 3 actually

# Answers to questions
  # 1. whichever country with more markers and more people infected probably 
  # had it first because it's had more time to progress and develop

  # 2. if the markers present are not the same in both countries, no bc the 
  # presence of different markers indicate morphing of the disease
